# Hospital Resource Utilization & Patient Outcomes Dashboard

## 📖 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to help hospital operations teams monitor and optimize resource utilization across departments in a mid-sized multi-specialty hospital.
The dashboard provides insights into patient admissions, bed occupancy, doctor workload, patient outcomes, and case types to support data-driven decision-making.
